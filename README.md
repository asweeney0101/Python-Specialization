# Exercise 1.1

This exercise was to set up our Python environment.  
We had to download Python 3.8.7 and configure our terminal to use that version.
Next we downloaded IDLE so that we can have a live, interactive Python environment, where we can test small functions.

Finally we created a couple virtual environments, and exported the requirements.txt file from one virtualEnv to another.

This was great practice for setting up and committing a Python Project

# Exercise 1.2

For each recipe, I will be using a dictionary, as it is a data structure I can add to later. Also it will be easier to store key-value pairs, as I won't have to wrap everything in curly braces, I can just type the key-value pairs.

For the all recipes, I will be using a list. A list can store dictionaries, can be added to, deleted, and reordered as I see fit.
